Problem Statement :

A sequence is considered as special only if there are no such pair of adjacent numbers in the sequence such that the pair consists of both odd or both even number.
You are provided with T test cases and for each test case you are given an array arr of size N. For each test case print "YES" it the sequence as special otherwise print "no"

Input Format:

The input is given in the following format:

  The first line contains an integer T denoting the number of test cane.
  Subsequent T test cases will have the first line as a single integer N, denoting the number of elements in the array arr
  Then, N subsequent lines contain a single integer, denoting the value of the element of the array arr

The input will be read from the STDIN by the candidate

Output Format:

  For each test case print "YES" if the sequence is special otherwise print "NO". The output will be matched to the candidate's output printed on the STDOUT

Constraints:
1<=T≤ 100,
1≤ N ≤ 10
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^5,

Example:

Input:
1
4
1
2
3
4

Output:
YES

Explanation:

For the given sequence there are no such pair of adjacent numbers that are both odd or both even numbers.

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int T ; 
    cin>> T;
    int N;
    for(int i = 1; i<= T ; i++){
        N = 0;
        cin>>N;
        int arr[N], temp;
        temp = 0;
        cin>>arr[0];
        for(int j = 1; j<N ; j++){
            cin>>arr[j];
            if(arr[j-1]%2 == 0 && arr[j] % 2 ==0){
                cout<<"NO";
                temp = 1;
                break;
            }
            if(arr[j-1]%2!= 0 && arr[j] % 2!=0){
                cout<<"NO";
                temp = 1;
                break;
            }
        }
        if(temp!=1)
        cout<<"YES";
    }

    return 0;
}
